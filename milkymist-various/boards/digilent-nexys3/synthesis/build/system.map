WARNING:MapLib:41 - All members of TNM group "clk72_pll" have been optimized out
   of the design.
WARNING:MapLib:50 - The period specification "TS_clk72_pll" has been discarded
   because the group "clk72_pll" has been optimized away.

WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net iosw/m0_ce_m1_ce_OR_414_o is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This
   is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net norflash_stb_norflash_cyc_AND_1290_o is sourced by a combinatorial
   pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <mem_wait_IBUF> is incomplete. The signal does not drive any load pins in the
   design.

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

Section 1 - Errors
------------------

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:MapLib:41 - All members of TNM group "clk72_pll" have been optimized out
   of the design.
WARNING:MapLib:50 - The period specification "TS_clk72_pll" has been discarded
   because the group "clk72_pll" has been optimized away.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net iosw/m0_ce_m1_ce_OR_414_o is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This
   is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net norflash_stb_norflash_cyc_AND_1290_o is sourced by a combinatorial
   pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <mem_wait_IBUF> is incomplete. The signal does not drive any load pins in the
   design.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:LIT:243 - Logical network mem_wait_IBUF has no load.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:Pack:1716 - Initializing temperature to 85.000 Celsius. (default - Range:
   0.000 to 85.000 Celsius)
INFO:Pack:1720 - Initializing voltage to 1.140 Volts. (default - Range: 1.140 to
   1.260 Volts)
INFO:Map:215 - The Interim Design Summary has been generated in the MAP Report
   (.mrp).
INFO:Pack:1650 - Map created a placed design.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
  11 block(s) removed
   2 block(s) optimized away
   7 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).

Loadless block "b_ac97" (CKBUF) removed.
 The signal "ac97_clk_bio" is loadless and has been removed.
Loadless block "b_phy_rx_clk" (CKBUF) removed.
Loadless block "b_phy_tx_clk" (CKBUF) removed.

Section 10 - Timing Report
--------------------------
A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static
timing analysis tools, Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line), with the
mapped NCD and PCF files. Please note that this timing report will be generated
using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
timing report with the post Place and Route NCD file.

For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing
Analyzer Reference Manual; for more information about TRCE, consult the Xilinx
Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.

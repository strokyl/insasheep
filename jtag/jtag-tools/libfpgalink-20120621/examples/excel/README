CALLING FPGALINK FROM EXCEL/VBA

This example sheet connects to the device at 1443:0005 (hopefully a 1200K Digilent Nexys2), loads
the onboard FX2 chip with a new firmware, loads the ex_cksum_nexys2-1200_fx2_vhdl.csvf design into
the board's FPGA, and then does some register reads and writes. The changes to the board are lost
on the next power cycle, so it's safe to try.

You may need to install the Visual C++ 2010 redistributable package:

The C functions in the FPGALink DLL are wrapped in VBA functions in the FPGALink module.

For Atlys and Nexys3, uncheck "Power on PD7" and enter "1443:0007" instead of "1443:0005" for
"Initial VID/PID" and "Renum VID/PID", and choose the appropriate SVF, XSVF or CSVF file for your
board.
